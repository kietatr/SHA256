# SHA256
## Kiet Tran and Katya Gurgel

(Trying to) implement SHA-256 in C.

## How to compile and run

In your Terminal, run these commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/kietatr/SHA256.git
cd SHA256
make
```

The `make` command will compile the source code, as well as run the compiled executable file for you.
